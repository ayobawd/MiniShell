42 Minishell Test Results Report
==================================================

TEST SUMMARY:
Echo Builtin Tests: 17 PASS / 22 FAIL
Other tests: Not yet run

T-A (parsing-origin): 0 failures (REPORT ONLY)
T-B (non-parsing): 4 failures (REQUIRE FIXES)

FAILED TESTS REQUIRING FIXES (T-B):
----------------------------------------
• echo (no args)
  Origin: src/execution/builtins.c
  Notes: Basic echo without arguments fails - likely issue with argument parsing

• echo with arguments
  Origin: src/execution/builtins.c
  Notes: Multiple echo tests with basic arguments fail

• echo -n flag handling
  Origin: src/execution/builtins.c
  Notes: Multiple -n flags not handled correctly (e.g., -nnnnn should be treated as single -n)

• echo with quotes
  Origin: src/execution/builtins.c, src/parsing/
  Notes: Quote handling in echo arguments may involve parsing but implementation in execution

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix echo builtin implementation for proper -n flag handling
2. Fix basic echo functionality (no args and with args)
3. Run full test suite on other builtins (cd, pwd, env, export, unset, exit)
4. Test pipeline and redirection functionality
